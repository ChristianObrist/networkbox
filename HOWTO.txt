Network requirements:

Router:
We assume you "own" a "network" with a working rooter, which provides ip - addresses and DNS-forwarding.
A normal wlan-box, with 2 Kat-5 networkports will be enough to build a testnetwork.
Pay attention, you have to turn of the dhcp-server, which provides ip – addresses, on your rooter later!
If you do not own a router, we recommend to use pfsense (https://www.pfsense.org/), an easy to install and use firewall running on every PC.

Installation “networkbox”
1. Install Ubuntu 14.04 server
Install a fresh ubuntu-server 14.04 (http://www.ubuntu.com/server). 
You should get all network-settings from your router.
Install all updates:
>> sudo apt-get update
>> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2. Install git:
>> sudo apt-get install git
